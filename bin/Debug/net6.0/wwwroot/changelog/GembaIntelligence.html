                <h2>Gemba Intelligence Module</h2>
                <p>OEE data contains a wealth of unplanned downtime and reject detail. Manually examining this detail every Shift for each Asset is a time-consuming process and, even then, it is easy to miss small changes that can potentially become bigger issues in the future.</p>
                <p>This is where Gemba Intelligence can help.</p>
                <p>By using a data analysis technique called ‘anomaly detection’, values that that deviate from normal behaviour are automatically identified and raised as incidents that require further examination.</p>
                <p>A suite of tools, including Gemba Intelligence Dashboard, Knowledge Base and Log Book Entry, are provided to help investigate and resolve any anomalies.</p>

                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                    <p>Gemba Intelligence uses an algorithm to determine how far a particular data point is from the rest of the data. Technically speaking, the distance is known as the <em>Z score</em> and refers to the number of standard deviations (<em>sigma</em> or σ) away from the mean.</p>
                    <p>The frequency of values within a dataset gives a distribution similar to that shown below, where 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation (i.e. with a <em>Z score</em> between -1 and +1), 95% within 2 standard deviations (<em>Z score</em> of -2 to +2) and 99.7% within three standard deviations (<em>Z score</em> of -3 to +3) from the mean.</p>
                    <p>The majority of data will have a <em>Z score</em> between 0 and +/-1. As <em>Z score</em> increases from the mean, the value becomes less common. A <em>Z score</em> of +/-3 or higher is commonly referred to as an outlier or an anomaly, but the actual <em>Z score</em> used can be configured within Gemba intelligence.</p>

                    <p>Using Availability % as an example, let’s assume the Availability of Machine 1 is commonly between 50% and 85% (the mean value 78%) over an 8-week period. The previous Shift Availability of 52% (<em>Z score</em> of 2.6) was within expected limits, but the current Shift Availability is 40.9% (<em>Z score</em> of 3.1). Clearly 40.9% is much lower than 78%, and so would be identified as an anomaly by Gemba Intelligence.</p>
                    <p>As another example, if Machine 2 typically runs between 75% and 78% then a Shift Availability of 70% would result in an anomaly being detected (<em>Z score</em> of 3.0). Even though this figure is above the Availability upper threshold of 60%, it is outside of the normal range and should be investigated. The key here is that the anomaly detection technique used by Gemba Intelligence adapts to the data.</p>

                    <p>In order to use Gemba Intelligence on an Asset the module must first be licenced and then the calculations enabled.</p>
                    <p>The Asset configuration grid in the Settings > Plant menu contains an Intelligence column to quickly show which Assets have Gemba Intelligence enabled.</p>
                    <p>To enable Gemba Intelligence for an Asset, Edit the Asset and navigate to the Gemba Intelligence tab. If the tab is not visible the module may not be licenced.</p>
                    <p>Click the Enabled switch to turn the feature on for that specific Asset, and pre-configure it with the default settings.</p>

                    <p><strong>OEE Upper Threshold Filter</strong> is a behaviour which prevents an anomaly from being raised if the OEE\Availability\Performance\Quality % are above the respective upper thresholds for the Asset. For example, if the Availability upper threshold is 70% and the Shift Availability is 73% don’t raise an Availability anomaly. By default, this behaviour is disabled.</p>
                    <p><strong>Planned Production Filter</strong> determines which Shifts are included in the calculations and eligible for anomaly detection. Only Shifts having Planned Production minutes greater than the filter minutes will be included. The default value is 0.</p>
                    <p><strong>Net Operating Time Filter</strong> is similar to the Planned Production Filter but applies to the calculated figure of Total Units / Standard upm. Use this setting to ignore Shifts where the effect of the Total Units produced falls below the threshold. The default value is 0.</p>

                    <p><strong>View Charts</strong> for Availability and Downtime/Frequency/MTTR anomalies displays an interactive pareto chart of unplanned downtimes for the Asset / Shift and a 14-day trend of both unplanned downtime duration and frequency.</p>
                    <p>When accessed via Availability, none of the individual downtimes are selected and the trend is total unplanned downtime and frequency for each Shift. Clicking on a pareto bar will highlight it and update the trend to show only the selected downtime.</p>

                    <p>The same chart is shown when accessed from a downtime duration/frequency anomaly but the corresponding pareto bar is pre-selected and the trend pre-filtered.</p>
                    <p>For rejects, the chart behaves in the same manner but displays a pareto of reject reasons instead.</p>
                    <p>View Charts option is not displayed for Performance anomalies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Parameter Changes</strong> menu lists Asset parameter changes made +/- 24 hours of the anomaly. Not many Assets support the recording of parameter changes so this may be blank.</p>
                    <p>For Performance anomalies, the Asset parameter list is filtered by the Asset parameters selected in the Asset configuration screen. This allows users to focus on settings which primarily affect machine speed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Log Book</strong> searches for any Log Book records for the Asset +/- 24 hours that contain information pertinent to the anomaly. It may be a component was replaced, a scheduled maintenance activity completed or even just a general comment relating to Asset function.</p>

                    <p><strong>Knowledge Base</strong> is only available for detail anomalies and returns any Articles containing potential solutions for the corresponding unplanned downtime or reject reasons.</p>
                    <p><img src="../images/gi/KnowledgeBase.png" /></p>
                    <p><strong>Create Action</strong> requires the Action module to be licenced and raises an Action to be assigned and resolved for the anomaly.</p>
                    <p>Actions are pre-populated with anomaly detail including the Asset and Shift.</p>
